    <p class= blogwritting> ASSIGNMENT BLOG </p>
        <p class="writting">I started my assignment from 3rd week of February and i was all new to me . I started my coding at sublime text. At the initial stage, i was making alot of errors at my work . The codes i typed were not working as per i wanted. Slowly i learnt from my mistakes and started to research about the codes structure and working mechanism.On that process i came accross many online tutorial websites . Although all of them were not helpful, some of them helped me learn many things and gave me confidence to explore nad try new  things on my  project. As a beginner, i made alot of mistakes while doing my assignment. My lecturer also help me on this project by suggesting what are the things that must be considered while doing the assignment. At the initial stage, i was totally unaware about the use of GIT and GITHUB. Slowly i started to be familiar with Git by the frequent use of it.<br><br>Initially i was facing any problems while uploading my work in github also. I was so confused that i also deleted my file mistakenly and i had to start my whole assignment from the beginning.It was a really great expirence for me as i got a chance to explore the frontend development feild and i got an opportunity to learn new this. The assignment has also helped me to increase my research skills.The frontend development itself is a very huge feild to explore and it was a great expirence. Though my first expirence designing a website was fun with exceptational knowledge, i came to know a lot about web development. </p>
