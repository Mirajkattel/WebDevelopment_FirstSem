    <div class="report"><h1>Overall Expirences</h1><p class="paragraph">As a begineer it was completely new topics and a different environment to get started with my assignment.At first i created my account in github. After that i downloaded sublime text and started my assignment. For the color theme of home page i took the color code from color hunt. I have used the same color code for each and every page of my assignment. After that i created a repository in github. Inside that repository i created a branch from master for each of the pages in my assignment and made my first commit in that repository. For the purpose of making my assignment look attractive, i took reference from google font. Creating the home page was really tough for me as i was not used to with all these coding and i had a really tough time researching and gaining knowledge about the development. After that creating portfolio page was a easy task for me as i was getting usedto with CSS, html and github. I included my details in portfolio page. Creating contact page was also a easy task . We were already taught how to make a form in class so it was easy creating the contact page . Writing blog was a different topic  which i had never tried before.I included everything how i started my assignment, mistakes i made while doing the assignment in my blog page. It was a completely new expirence which i enjoyed alot discovering it. I really enjoyed doing my assignment and using Github, Sublime and many more.It gave me an opportunity to explore the feild which i never had an idea about. </p><br><br>
